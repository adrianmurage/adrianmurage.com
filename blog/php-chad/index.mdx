## Day 0 - 10/04/2022

The challenge here is simple. Build out a Junior Developer test project in 20ish days.

The caveats:
- Use PHP. Having never used PHP to build anything before, I'll be figuring out a language and using it to build something in 20ish days. No pressure.

The Upperhands:
- I can figure out anything you throw at me. All I need is the internet and a little time.
- I have the internet and the book "Learning PHP, MySQL, & JavaScript WITH JQUERY, CSS & HTML5" by OREILLY.

The breakdown of the challenge is documented on this [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Junior-Developer-Test-Task-1b2184e40dea47df840b7c0cc638e61e).

This is day 0 and no coding will be taking place. I spent sometime reading through the task breakdown and mentally preparing myself to start the challenge tomorrow.

To becoming a PHP chad ðŸ¥‚. Lol ðŸ˜‚.

## Day 1 - 11/04/2022

The first thing I'll do is figure out how to wire up PHP with a MYSQL database then deploy it.

All the testing and grading of this project will be done on a deployed site. So I think it would be wise to work with it deployed from the word go.

The main benefit of this is to pick up on any breaking changes in realtime. Work on it everyday, deploy everyday. 

For hosting I'll go with Heroku. For local development I'll go with XAMPP.

I am currently developing on windows. But I do have access to a linux environment via [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). 

So I:
1. Downloaded [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
2. Download [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

```php file=index.php
<?php 
echo "Hello there Heroku, Adrian here!"
?>
```

Okay so I got some output on my XAMPP server. So that's great!

![Hello world PHP](./hello_world_php.png)

I  added version control. My choice being git and everything now lives in this [git repository](https://github.com/adrianmurage/product_listing).

Using these two resources, I got the app deployed on heroku:
1. [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php#deploy-the-app)
2. [How to Deploy a PHP and MySQL site to Heroku and configure the database with PHPMyAdmin](https://www.doabledanny.com/Deploy-PHP-And-MySQL-to-Heroku)

The app is deployed on https://murage-product-listing.herokuapp.com/

![Hello world in php on heroku](./heroku_hello_world_php.png)

The next step is to hook up the MYSQL database. 

After following through resource 2 under how I got the app deployed on heroku above, I hit a dead end when I tried to connect to the database from my php file. 

So I'll try switching resources and learn how to connect to a database from my OREILLY book.

From a little learning, I've figured out that the connection method on the article works for the deployed version of the app. However it does not work locally on my XAMPP server. I think figuring out how to setup env variables for local development will enable me to get it to work locally so that I don't need to keep playing with the connection string every time I need to develop locally. 

So now we learn about env varialbes in PHP ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

![One eternity later meme](./one_eternity_later.jpg)

I finally figured out how to add the variables. With a little help from this here [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37570410/how-to-set-environment-variables-in-apache-xampp).

tl;dr

I created a `.htaccess` file in my folder then added in the env variable like so:

```php
SetEnv CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL "get this value from the Heroku config"
```

And that got my local app working exactly like the deployed app!

Which marks the end of day 1 learning and building with PHP ðŸ¥³

What I accomplished today:
1. Setup a local PHP development enviroment
2. Setup a remote database and connected it to my PHP app
3. Deployed my PHP app
4. Accessed data stored in my PHP app
