i find the idea around creating [interactive playgrounds with React interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL8cz2W0z34&ab_channel=ReactConf2021).

[mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) makes mixing up written material with interactive react components possible and that was really what sold the idea for me. 

Delba's post [a like button that likes you back](https://delba.dev/blog/a-like-button-that-likes-you-back) shows the direction that i wish to go with this.

super excited to see how this goes : )
