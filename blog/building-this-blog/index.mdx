I have had about 4 personal blogs. Including this one. Two that utilized ready made templates and two that I built myself. 

## Ready made templates: 

### Jekyll blog
I picked up a ready made theme and ran with it.

### A Gatsby blog
I picked up a theme and ran with it.

## Ones I built myself
### Hugo blog
I tried to understand how to build a blog using Hugo and failed. 
Not entirely because I built something. But that effort quickly fizzled out.

### Gatsby blog
I followed the official gatsby tutorial https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/ to build it.
